**Discrete Geometry First: Collapsing High-Dimensional Lattice Enumeration from O(r^N) to Quasi-Quadratic O(r^2 log_2 N log r)**

For over two centuries, the standard approach to discrete lattice point enumeration has relied on continuous Euclidean tools—transcendental functions, Bessel expansions, modular forms, and floating-point approximations—projected onto integer grids. This approach frequently runs into boundary-vertex collisions, floating-point precision drift, and the classical exponential coordinate bottleneck.

Instead of forcing continuous calculus onto discrete space, I developed an integer-native geometric framework that treats discrete grids on their own native algebraic terms. By recognizing that squared Euclidean distance is additively separable across orthogonal submanifolds, high-dimensional boundaries can be decoupled and evaluated via single-pass integer dot products and discrete cross-convolutions.

The complete research suite consists of five preprints establishing the theoretical derivations, asymptotic complexity proofs, and hardware-native C++ reference implementations:

*   **Paper I: An Integer-Only Orthotropic Lattice Enumeration Framework and Asymptotic Convergence of Discrete Rational π**
    *   *Core Premise:* Couples orthotropic boundaries 4r ± 1 to construct Diophantine parity constraints that mathematically prohibit boundary-vertex collisions.
    *   *Result:* Resolves boundary discrepancy and derives a deterministic, rational convergence envelope for discrete π_d ∈ ℚ.
    *   *Zenodo DOI:* [10.5281/zenodo.22282210](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22282210) | *GitHub:* [orthotropic-parity-and-discrete-pi](https://github.com/Andrew-J-Morris/orthotropic-parity-and-discrete-pi)

*   **Paper II: A Dimension-Paired Combinatorial Framework: Asymptotic O(r^2) Reduction and O(r^2 log_2 N log r) Generalized Convolution for High-Dimensional Discrete Lattice Enumeration**
    *   *Core Premise:* Decomposes 4D space as orthogonal planes (Z^4 ≅ Z^2 × Z^2), reducing 4-space enumeration from O(r^4) to a single-pass 1D dot product in strict O(r^2) without floating-point operations.
    *   *Generalization:* Applies recursive bisection via Number Theoretic Transforms (NTT) in finite fields Z_p[t], collapsing N-dimensional ball enumeration to O(r^2 log_2 N log r).
    *   *Zenodo DOI:* [10.5281/zenodo.22509388](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22509388) | *GitHub:* [dimension-paired-cross-convolution](https://github.com/Andrew-J-Morris/dimension-paired-cross-convolution)

*   **Paper III: Hierarchical Dimension-Pairing: Hardware-Native O(r^2) Enumeration of 5D through 8D Spherical Lattices and High-Dimensional Capacity Limits**
    *   *Core Premise:* Neutralizes the historical odd-dimension class-number barrier for Z^5 and Z^7 by slicing 1D axial profiles against precomputed even-dimensional hyperdisk profiles.
    *   *Empirical Scaling:* Verifies sequences against OEIS baselines (A000333–A000336), and benchmarks a 1024-dimensional R = 2896 hyperball (output = 831168560 (mod 998244353)) in 1561.833 ms on a single desktop core.
    *   *Zenodo DOI:* [10.5281/zenodo.22691273](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22691273) | *GitHub:* [hierarchical-ntt-bisection](https://github.com/Andrew-J-Morris/hierarchical-ntt-bisection)

*   **Paper IV: Parity-Filtered Bisection: Hardware-Native O(r^2) Enumeration of Optimal D_N Lattices**
    *   *Core Premise:* Extends the bisection architecture beyond primitive grids to dense, non-orthogonal kissing-number lattices. By redefining geometries as parity-constrained sublattices of Z^N (∑ x_i ≡ 0 (mod 2)), internal coordinate staggering is fully absorbed into pre-filtered arrays.
    *   *Result:* Achieves hardware-native O(r^2) exact enumeration for Face-Centered Cubic (D_3), the 24-cell honeycomb (D_4), and the D_8 root lattice, verified bit-for-bit against OEIS A005875, A004011, and A004013.
    *   *Zenodo DOI:* [10.5281/zenodo.22824219](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22824219) | *GitHub:* [parity-filtered-kissing-lattices](https://github.com/Andrew-J-Morris/parity-filtered-kissing-lattices)

*   **Paper V: Parity-Filtered Bisection of the E_8 Lattice: Hardware-Native Dimension-Paired Enumeration via Diophantine Scalar Transformation**
    *   *Core Premise:* Resolves the fractional half-integer coordinate union inherent to standard E_8 geometry via a uniform 2E_8 scalar dilation, mapping the continuous domain into discrete All-Even and All-Odd parity sublattices governed by an invariant modulo-4 sum constraint.
    *   *Result:* Extends the O(r^2) complexity collapse to the densest 8D sphere packing, accelerating 4D submanifolds via sparse-index traversal and resolving terminal volumes in single-pass dot products, verified bit-for-bit against OEIS A004010.
    *   *Zenodo DOI:* [10.5281/zenodo.22962066](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22962066) | *GitHub:* [e8-parity-bisection](https://github.com/Andrew-J-Morris/e8-parity-bisection)

**The Empirical Validation**

The C++ implementations are designed as self-contained, reproducible test benches running exclusively on 64-bit integer ALUs with zero floating-point emulation:
*   Resolving 246+ million points in the 4D 24-cell honeycomb at R=100 in 2 ms on consumer hardware.
*   Pushing the finite-field Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) bisection tree to its theoretical single-prime 2-adic ceiling (R = 2896, transform size M = 2^23), evaluating a 1024-dimensional hyperball across an 8.38-million-element ring in 1,561 ms on a single desktop core.
*   Evaluating 7-dimensional bounding hyperballs from R = 0..5000, culminating in a bit-perfect 27-digit lattice point count, thereby extending OEIS A055413 from R = 0..500 to R = 0..5000.
*   Resolving 8-dimensional E_8 lattice bounds through n = 10,000 (scaled domain bound ||y||^2 <= 80,000), accumulating 649,533,725,496,097,441 points in 606 ms on consumer hardware, verified 100% bit-exact against the modular divisor sum sieve (OEIS A004010).

All five preprints, source code, and benchmark suites are open-access. Feedback on the combinatorial proofs, algorithmic bounds, and hardware pipelining is welcome.
